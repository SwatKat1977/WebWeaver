class StudioBrowser:
    """
    High-level wrapper around a Selenium WebDriver instance used by WebWeaver Studio.

    This class acts as the single integration point between the Studio application and
    the underlying browser automation engine (Selenium).

    Responsibilities:
    - Provide a stable, high-level API for browser interaction
    - Centralise navigation, lifecycle management, and utilities (screenshots, etc)
    - Act as an abstraction layer so the rest of the application does not depend directly
      on Selenium APIs
    - Serve as a future extension point for recording actions, logging, retries, waits,
      and error handling

    The raw Selenium driver is intentionally hidden behind this wrapper. If low-level
    access is required, it can be obtained via the `raw` property.
