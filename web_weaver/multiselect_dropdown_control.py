    """
    A web control abstraction for interacting with multi-select `<select>`
    elements.

    This class extends `BaseWebControl` to provide higher-level operations for
    selecting and deselecting multiple options. It uses Selenium's `Select`
    helper under the hood and validates that the underlying element supports
    multiple selection.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> ms = MultiSelectDropdownControl(driver, logger).attach((By.ID, "fruits"))
    >>> ms.select_by_text("Apple")
    >>> ms.select_by_text("Banana")
    >>> assert set(ms.get_all_selected_texts()) == {"Apple", "Banana"}
    >>> ms.deselect_all()
